CSMA/CD - listen the wire to make sure that no other station is transmiting, if no other station is transmiting the station transmit
	-> if a collision occurs, the transmitting stations detect the collision and run a random backoff alghorithm, to wait a random time before retransmit


UTP Cable - Max 100m 
	-> straight-through - uses pins 1,2,3 and 6 not crossed
	-> crossover - in cat5 1 and 3 are switched and 2 and 6 are switched in one end of the cable
	-> cat1 - tele
	-> cat2 - 4mb
	-> cat3 - 10mb
	-> cat4 - 16mb
	-> cat5 - 100mb
	-> cat5e - 1gb
	-> cat6e - 10gb

Fiber
	-> MMF - supports shorter distances than SMF, MMF could use led

MAC
	-> Layer 2 address
	-> Hexadecimal format
	-> 48 bits - 24 for the vendor(OUI) - 24 for the identifie
	-> is discovered via ARP

Switch
	-> Uses Mac Address table - is construct by the source mac that pass into the switch
	-> Uses transparent brdging flooding - Learning, Flooding, Filtering,Forwarding,Aging
	-> Transparent bridging flooding - if the switch dont know the mac, flood for all ports except from the source port
	-> Aging = mark in the mac table
	-> Forwarding = switch has the destination in mac table
	-> Filtering = host and destination reside on the same itnerface, the switch discard the frame
	-> Flooding = flood to all ports to delivery the frame
	-> Learn = learn the mac from source
	-> Replace a hub with a switch eliminates collision, because each port is separete collision domain, eliminate the need of CSMA/CD

Duplex
	-> If 2 interfaces have full duplex activated, device can send and receive at same time, dont have collision
	-> Double the amount of bandwidth
	-> To view the duplex and speed in cisco cli, you need to do the command, show interface [INTERFACE]
	-> Duplex mismatch causes slowly and collisions (one device in full and other in half-duplex)
	-> Cyclic redundancy checks errors usually indicate a problem with the net cable

errDisable

	-> EtherChannel misconfiguration.
	-> Duplex mismatch.
    	-> Bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) port guard has been enabled on the port.
    	-> Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD).
   	-> A native VLAN mismatch.

Runts
	-> Runts are frames smaller than 64 bytes with a bad frame check sequence (FCS)
	-> Bad cabling or inconsistent duplex settings usually cause runts.
